## Lossless Pic2HTML


</div>

### Description

I've noticed a lot of "Pic2HTML" programs lately that will turn an image file into an ASCII image of similar colors. While this is a good idea, I figured I'd spend an hour and code an algorithm that was lossless (IE: Final HTML picture is *EXACTLY* the same as the original image file). The algorithm is in the "Generate Code" button and even though it's fairly optimized, it still uses a lot of RAM and takes a while for large image files (it even has some "intelligence" to notice pixel clusters, but that didn't increase the speed: it only decreased the output size). Enjoy.
